# PM2.5 Concentration Estimation using LightGBM Ensemble

This project predicts PM2.5 concentrations in Delhi (2020â€“2021) using satellite data, reanalysis data, and meteorological features. It employs a LightGBM-based ensemble model, optimized with Optuna, and saved as `.joblib` files for later inference.

## Overview

- Goal: Estimate ground-level PM2.5 from satellite AOD and meteorological inputs.
- Approach: Regression using LightGBM + Optuna for tuning + Ensemble of 5 models.
- Data: Cleaned and feature-engineered dataset (delhidata.csv) from 2020â€“2021.
- Output: Predicted PM2.5 concentration (Âµg/mÂ³).

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

Run this command in your terminal:

    pip install -r model/requirements.txt

### 2. Train Model

This will train an ensemble of 5 models and save them to `model/savedmodels/`:

    python model/trained.py

### 3. Predict PM2.5 (Interactive)

Run this script and follow prompts to enter input features:

    python model/predict.py

Example user input:

    ðŸ“¥ Enter feature values for PM2.5 prediction:
    PM10: 180
    NO2: 45
    ...
    Month_cat (e.g. Jan, Feb...): Jan
    Season (Winter / Pre-monsoon / ...): Winter
    DayOfWeek_cat (Mon, Tue, ...): Tue

Example output:

    âœ… PM2.5 Prediction Completed.
    ðŸ“ˆ Predicted PM2.5 Concentration: 134.72 Âµg/mÂ³
